<h3>
    Minimum things to get started with programming.
</h3>
<small>27 Sep 2021 | Yogesh Gupta </small>

<p style="text-align:center">
    Most of the people think programming languages as something very very different from the languages we use to communicate in our daily lives. Any programming language is just like an English language but with a proper structure to follow. Programming languages have rules which strictly needs to be followed by all the people using it. It has a set of standards defined by the non-profits / organisations / societies maintaing it.

    So how does programming language actually differ from English or other language we use for communication ?<br>
    1. No slang - We come across many slangs in our daily lives for which the meaning is relevant/known to specific context or group of people.
        E.g - Dope which means cool or very exciting<br>
    2. Community - All the programming language and libraries are maintained by group of people with a common objective but this might or might not be true for the communication languages.<br>
    3. Very strict - The rules / syntax and standards have to be follwed to the dot.<br>
    4. Common standard - Unlike English language the standards does not differ by region or countries.<br>

    Okay now we know the differences and somewhat understand how programming languages differ from communication languages.
    But what is the minimum we must know to get started programming ?<br>

    As a newbie programmer I have realised we must understand the following things:<br>

    1. Variables - A variable in a programming language is simply a name for which we can assign some value and that value can be updated over time. This is very basic and important concept
    which allows the value to be refrenced again and again for manipulation.<br>

    E.g - If we have a diameter with some value we can easily calculate the radius (diameter/2), area of circle (pi*r*r) and display it to the
    user.<br>

    2. Loops - Loops are a repitive task that is performed on a data or an input to get a result. Imagine finding all the even numbers between 1 and 10,000.
    Its tedious and would take a lot of time if done manually. But with the help of loop we can take each number from 1 to 10,000 check for even number and display the result very very quickly in milliseconds.<br>


    3. Functions - Functions are a block of code which would perform a specific task whenever it is called repeatedly. Assume if we have length, breadth and height of a cube and want to find its volume.
        We can simply pass the values of length,breadth,height to a function and get the volume for as many cubes as we want.<br>

    4. Conditions - Many times the code we write might have varying results and based on that we would want to perform a specific task. Assume we are calculating profit
    and loss for shares we own the stock market. Depending on the difference (positive or negative) between buy price and current price we can tell the user if he has made profit or loss.
