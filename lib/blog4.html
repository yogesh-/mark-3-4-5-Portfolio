<h3>
    Not giving up on programming. Thanks to NeoG
</h3>

<small>27 Sep 2021 | Yogesh Gupta</small>

<p style="text-align:center">
    I randomly came across a tweet of Tanay announcing something about NeoG. I just thought this is just another programming bootcamp like so many others. 
    I had applied to some of them earlier but they did not accept me because of my background. But more i read and dug deeper about NeoG I instantly felt I should give this a shot.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center">
    I tried to learn to program many times in the past. More precisely 6 times in the last 5 years and I failed. I followed different youtube courses, udacity,
    codecademy etc among so many others. Each time i would pick up new programming language or a learning platform thinking this is easier and more faster
    as per the google search and youtube videos. I failed everytime.

   I realised now why i was failing all these past years while i started learning at NeoG.

</p>

<h5>Reasons I failed in the past</h5>

1. <span style="font-weight: bold">Watching videos or learning?</span> - I started learning by watching youtube videos. While it is a great platform for learning new things.
But in my case it did not work perfectly for learning programming. Like majority of people I used to simply watch the video and do nothing.
Watching the videos gave a sense of accomplishment but I was not learning anything concrete just becasuse of no implementation.<br>
2. <span style="font-weight: bold">No Community</span> - I was not a part of the community of learners or developers. This made learning bland. Being a part of the community helps a lot. I cant imagine learning so much at NeoG till now without the community<br>
3. <span style="font-weight: bold">No job assistance/guidance</span> - The biggest reason of my failure. This lead me to give up in just few weeks after starting to learn. I am learning on codecademy but what after that ? Who would hire me ? I have a non-tech background.
There was absolutely no assitance and support leading to job after learning. I thought I am shooting in the dark.<br>
4. <span style="font-weight: bold">Background</span> - My background was a big hinderance while applying to bootcamps online. They would simply take the recent engineering passouts with high fees and Income sharing agreements.They did not accept people with non-tech background <br>
