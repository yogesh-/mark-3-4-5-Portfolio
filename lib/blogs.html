            <p>

                development is JavaScript. Lets see the advantges and disadvantages of using the same.

            <h1>Why React JS ?
            </h1>
            <small>11th Aug 2021</small>
            <p>
                React.js is the most popular front-end JavaScript library for building Web applications. 
                React.js or Reactjs or simply React are different ways to represent React.js. 
                Most fortune 500 companies use Reactjs.
                In this article, we will learn what React.js (or simply React or Reactjs) is and why we should use Reactjs instead of other JavaScript frameworks like Angular.

            <small>27th Sept 2021</small>
            <p>
                Most of the people think programming languages as something very very different from the languages we use to communicate in our daily lives. 
                Any programming language is just like an English language but with a proper structure and rules to follow. 
                It has a set of standards defined by the non-profits / organisations / societies maintaing it.            </p>

            <h1> Not giving up on programming. Thanks to NeoG.
            </h1>
            <small>27th Sept 2021</small>
            <p>
                I randomly came across a tweet of Tanay announcing something about NeoG. I just thought this is just another programming bootcamp like so many others.
                I had applied to some of them earlier but they did not accept me because of my background. But more i read and dug deeper about NeoG I instantly felt I should give this a shot.
